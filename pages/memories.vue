	  I remember when Amy and I broke the news to Ken that he was going to be a grandfather, we gifted him a bottle of "Old Grandad" whiskey.  He got the joke after some nudging!<br><br>

	  I remember visiting the art museum in Chicago and Ken telling about <i>trompe l'oeil</i>.  I sort of recalled it through taking art class with him in high school, but I felt pretty lucky to be touring an art museum with <b>two</b> teachers of art!<br><br>

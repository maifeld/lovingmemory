	  This will be my 45th  class reunion from HCSD and Mr. Anderson will always be the most encouraging and favorite teacher Iâ€™ve ever had.  Due to his influence I went on to get my Bachelor of Fine Arts from Drake, and have thought of him often over the years.<br><br>

	  Dad was the parent who was elected (volun-told?) to teach us how to drive.  A few months after receiving my learner's permit, he decided I was ready to try driving on the interstate.  Thankfully, the stretch of I-35 near Hampton doesn't have much traffic, but we came upon a car going a few miles an hour slower, and Dad encouraged me to pass them.  I carefully signalled and pulled into the left lane.  But Dad forgot to tell me one important detail: don't pull back in front of the vehicle you are passing until you see both their headlights in your rearview mirror.  Not knowing this, I promptly proceeded to slowly but confidently cut off the car, as Dad said, "Amy.  Amy.  AMY.  AMYAMYAMYAMY!"  After we both collected ourselves, THEN he told me the rule.  I can't always follow it in Houston traffic - no one does - but when I do, I always think of him.<br><br>

	  When I was in high school, my dad asked if I wanted to go see a movie, just him and me. We saw Forrest Gump at the Iowa Falls theater, and to this day it's still one of my favorite movies. Dad was the best date!<br><br>

	  When I was very young, I remember I didn't want Dad to go to work. I cried and kept running after him to give him "one last hug". He finally had to get in the car (Pumpkin) and speed away so he could get going. I really wish I could still give him that hug now.<br><br>

	  I remember when Amy and I broke the news to Ken that he was going to be a grandfather, we gifted him a bottle of "Old Grand Dad" Bourbon whiskey.  He got the joke after some nudging!<br><br>

	  I remember visiting the art museum in Chicago and Ken telling about <i>trompe l'oeil</i>.  I sort of recalled it through taking art class with him in high school, but I felt pretty lucky to be touring an art museum with <b>two</b> teachers of art!<br><br>

Since Node 17, the default OpenSSL implementation has changed. Unfortunately, they decided to only fix this in Webpack 5 and not Webpack 4 (which we still use).
For now, a workaround would be to set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider (see comment).

For Linux/Mac:
export NODE_OPTIONS='--openssl-legacy-provider expo start --web'
